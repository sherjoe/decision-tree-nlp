# Gradient-Boosted-NLP

I compared different decision tree models to a book reviews (not actual book reviews just pre-written samples to train off of) dataset with one and label. I used TD-IDF in order to use NLP. Gradient Boosted Decision Tree came out on top, due to the mode's way of gradually improving on its mistakes over time. (〃＾▽＾〃)
